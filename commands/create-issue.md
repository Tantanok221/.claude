# Create Issue Command

Create comprehensive, steering-aware issue documents that provide rich context for implementation planning and development workflow.

## Usage
```
/create-issue <feature_description> [--ticket-id TICKET_ID]
```

## Instructions
You are creating well-structured issue documents that integrate with the steering-aware development workflow. These issues will be consumed by `/plan` command for implementation planning, so they must contain sufficient technical detail and architectural context.

**ULTRATHINK MODE ACTIVATED**: This is critical issue creation that requires deep analysis of both the feature requirements and existing architectural context. Use maximum tokens to thoroughly understand the feature, analyze relevant steering documents, and create the most comprehensive issue possible. Think deeply about implementation complexity, architectural patterns, and how this feature fits into the existing system.


**PURPOSE**: Create steering-aware issues that enable accurate implementation planning and maintain architectural consistency throughout the development workflow.

## Process

### 1. **Git Branch Management**
   **Use Git Branch Manager Agent**: Use the git-branch-manager agent to ensure the current branch is the project's master/main branch and is up-to-date, handling all branch checking and switching operations.
   
   **Context for Agent**: The agent will be configured to ensure the master/main branch is active and up-to-date for issue creation work.
   
   **Agent Execution**: Wait for the git-branch-manager agent to complete its operation. If the agent indicates a failure (e.g., uncommitted changes conflict, Git operation failure), notify the user of the specific issue and exit this command.

### 2. **Load and Analyze Steering Context**
   **Before creating the issue, understand the architectural landscape:**
   
   **Check for Steering Documents:**
   - Look for `steering/` directory
   - If steering documents don't exist, inform user and suggest running `/steering-setup`
   - If steering exists, proceed with steering-aware issue creation
   
   **Use Steering Context Reader Agent**: Use the steering-context-reader agent to gather relevant steering documentation for this feature.
   
   **Context for Agent**: "I'm creating an issue for '{feature_description}'. This feature appears to involve {identified-feature-areas}. I need relevant steering context to create a comprehensive issue that aligns with project standards, architectural patterns, and coding guidelines."
   
   **Agent Execution**: Wait for the steering-context-reader agent to return relevant steering context for this feature.

### 3. **Research the Project**
   - Examine the current project's structure, existing issues directory (if it exists), and documentation
   - Look for any CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates, or similar files that might contain guidelines for creating issues
   - Note the project's coding style, naming conventions, and any specific requirements for issue documentation
   - Check if there's an existing issues/ directory structure and naming conventions
   - **Cross-reference with steering documents** for consistency

### 4. **Research Best Practices** 
   - Search for current best practices in writing issue documentation, focusing on clarity, completeness, and actionability
   - Look for examples of well-written issues in popular open-source projects for inspiration
   - Search the web for best practices on the topics handled
   - **Integrate steering document patterns** with industry best practices
   - **Detect Library/Framework Keywords**: Analyze feature description for specific technologies, frameworks, libraries, integrations, or migration requirements that would benefit from current documentation research

### 4.5. **Library/Framework Documentation Research**
   **Use tech-doc-agent when feature involves specific technologies:**
   
   **Detection Keywords in Feature Description:**
   - Library/framework names: "React", "Express", "OAuth", "JWT", "Stripe", "GraphQL", "MongoDB", etc.
   - Integration patterns: "integrate with", "connect to", "add authentication", "payment processing"
   - Migration tasks: "migrate from", "upgrade to", "replace with", "modernize"
   - Technology-specific features: "API integration", "database migration", "authentication system"
   
   **Tech Doc Agent Integration Process:**
   ```
   IF feature description contains library/framework keywords:
   1. Use tech-doc-agent with comprehensive feature context
   2. Pass detailed context about the feature requirements
   3. Receive focused documentation analysis for issue planning
   4. Integrate findings into issue document structure
   ```
   
   **Context to Provide to Tech Doc Agent:**
   ```
   "I'm creating an issue for: {feature_description}
   
   **Problem Context**: {what business problem this feature solves}
   **Technical Context**: {existing system architecture from steering docs}
   **Feature Requirements**: {functional and technical requirements}
   **Scope**: Issue creation phase - need current best practices and implementation guidance
   **Integration Needs**: {detected libraries, services, or frameworks involved}
   
   I need current documentation insights for: {detected technologies}
   Focus on: {implementation patterns, architectural considerations, integration approaches, security patterns}"
   ```
   
   **Tech Doc Agent Execution:**
   - Wait for tech-doc-agent to return focused documentation analysis
   - Integrate findings into issue requirements and implementation guidance
   - Include current best practices and architectural patterns
   - Reference version-specific considerations and integration approaches
   - Identify security and performance considerations for the technologies

### 5.5. **Issue Clarification and Requirements Brainstorm**
   **Interactive brainstorming process to clarify and enhance the user's feature description:**
   
   **Issue Clarification Initialization:**
   - Analyze the initial feature description for gaps, ambiguities, and missing context
   - Review gathered steering context and tech-doc-agent insights to identify clarification needs
   - Generate requirements-focused questions based on business and technical scope gaps
   
   **Use Gemini CLI Brainstorm MCP**: Use the mcp__gemini-cli__brainstorm tool to enhance issue clarity through iterative requirements gathering.
   
   **Context for Issue Brainstorm Tool:**
   ```
   "I'm creating a comprehensive issue document for the feature: {feature_description}
   
   **Initial Context**: {user-provided-feature-description}
   **Steering Insights**: {relevant-architectural-patterns-and-constraints}
   **Technology Context**: {tech-doc-agent-findings-if-applicable}
   **Project Context**: {existing-system-architecture-and-patterns}
   
   I need to brainstorm clarifying questions to create a comprehensive, well-defined issue document. The original description may be missing important details about:
   - Business context and value proposition
   - Technical requirements and constraints
   - User experience and workflow details
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Success criteria and acceptance criteria
   - Edge cases and error scenarios
   
   Generate thoughtful clarifying questions that will help me gather the missing context and create a more comprehensive issue document that enables accurate design and implementation planning."
   ```
   
   **Iterative Issue Clarification Process:**
   
   **Initial Clarification Round:**
   - Call mcp__gemini-cli__brainstorm with comprehensive feature context
   - Present 3-5 most relevant clarifying questions to user based on brainstorm results
   - Focus on critical gaps in business context, technical scope, and user requirements
   
   **Issue Clarification Question Categories:**
   ```

   - "What are the technical constraints or limitations to consider?"
   - "Are there team dependencies or coordination requirements?"
   - "What documentation or training materials will need to be updated?"
   ```
   
   **User Response Collection:**
   ```markdown
   Based on the feature description, I have these clarifying questions to create a comprehensive issue:
   
   ðŸ“‹ **Business & Requirements Questions:**
   1. {business-context-question-1}
   2. {user-value-question-2}
   3. {success-criteria-question-3}
   
   ðŸ”§ **Technical & Implementation Questions:**
   4. {technical-scope-question}
   5. {integration-or-constraint-question}
   
   Please provide additional context to help me create a more detailed and actionable issue document.
   You can also respond with:
   - "issue clear" - Sufficient detail provided for issue creation
   - "sufficient detail" - Proceed with current information
   - "more questions" - Ask additional clarifying questions
   ```
   
   **Follow-up Clarification Rounds (if needed):**
   - **Continue if user provides substantial additional context**: Generate follow-up questions based on new information
   - **Stop if user indicates sufficient clarity**: "issue clear", "sufficient detail", "proceed with creation"
   - **Stop if minimal new context**: Agent determines enough information gathered for comprehensive issue
   - **Maximum 3 clarification rounds**: Prevent user fatigue and infinite loops
   
   **Follow-up Question Generation:**
   - Use mcp__gemini-cli__brainstorm again with updated context including user responses
   - Focus on areas that still need clarification based on previous answers
   - Generate 2-3 targeted follow-up questions maximum per round
   
   **Issue Clarification Results Synthesis:**
   - Capture all user responses and requirements insights from brainstorm sessions
   - Identify business context and value proposition clarifications
   - Note technical requirements and constraints discovered
   - Document user experience and workflow details provided
   - Prepare enhanced feature context for issue document generation
   
   **Enhanced Issue Context Integration:**
   ```json
   {
     "issue_clarification_insights": {
       "business_context": "Clarified business problem and value proposition",
       "user_requirements": ["Requirement 1", "Requirement 2", "Requirement 3"],
       "technical_constraints": ["Constraint 1", "Constraint 2"],
       "success_criteria": ["Criteria 1", "Criteria 2"],
       "integration_needs": ["Integration 1", "Integration 2"],
       "user_workflows": ["Workflow 1", "Workflow 2"],
       "edge_cases": ["Edge case 1", "Edge case 2"],
       "user_clarifications": {
         "question": "user response",
         "follow_up": "additional context"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### 6. **Handle Ticket ID and Linear Integration**
   **Ticket ID Processing:**
   - If a ticket ID is provided via --ticket-id, use that ID
   - If no ticket ID is provided:
     a. Ask the user if they want to provide a custom ticket ID
     b. Wait for user response
     c. If user provides a ticket ID, use it
     d. If user declines or says they don't want to provide one, then create a short, descriptive ticket ID by summarizing the feature description into 2-4 words, using kebab-case format (e.g., "fix-login-button", "add-dark-mode", "mobile-safari-bug")

   **Linear MCP Integration:**
   - If a ticket ID is provided and follows Linear format (e.g., "PG-123"), attempt to fetch ticket details from Linear:
     ```
     Use MCP Linear tools to:
     1. Fetch issue details by ID using mcp__linear-server__get_issue
     2. Extract relevant information: title, description, status, priority, assignee, team, project, labels, estimate, url, gitBranchName
     3. Include Linear URL and comprehensive project context
     4. Use this information to enhance the issue document with Linear context
     ```
   
   **Linear Information Integration:**
   - If Linear ticket found:
     - Use Linear title and description as additional context
     - Include Linear metadata: status, priority, assignee, team, project, labels, estimate, due_date
     - Reference the Linear ticket URL in the issue document
     - Cross-reference Linear requirements with local steering documents
     - Enhance business context with Linear project and team information
   - If Linear ticket not found or MCP unavailable:
     - Continue with standard issue creation process
     - Note the ticket ID for future reference

### 7. **Present Steering-Informed Plan**
   - Based on your research and steering analysis, outline a plan for creating the issue document
   - Include the proposed structure of the issue, the ticket ID, filename format, and how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions
   - **Show which steering documents influenced the plan**
   - Present this plan in `<plan>` tags
   - Include any reference links to feature base or other sources that have the source of the user request
   - Please ensure any references to local files with line numbers or repositories are included at the bottom of the issue document for future reference

### 8. **Create Comprehensive Issue Document**

### 9. **Save the File**
   - Create the issues directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p issues`
   - Save the issue document as `issues/{ticket_id}-issue.md`
   - Ask the user if they want to add the `issues/` directory to `.git/info/exclude`:
     ```
     Do you want to add the `issues/` directory to `.git/info/exclude` to keep 
     issue documents local and out of version control?
     
     - "yes" - Add issues/ to .git/info/exclude for local-only exclusions
     - "no" - Skip git exclusion (issue documents may be committed)
     ```
     
     **If user says "yes":**
     - Use `.git/info/exclude` for local-only exclusions (not shared with the team)
     - Add "issues/" to `.git/info/exclude` if it's not already there
     - Use commands like: `echo "issues/" >> .git/info/exclude` (but check for duplicates first)
     
     **If user says "no":**
     - Continue without adding git exclusion
     - Inform user that issue documents may be committed to the repository
   - Ensure proper file permissions and formatting

### 10. **Final Output**
   - Present the complete issue document content in `<issue_document>` tags
   - Include the full file path where it will be saved
   - **Include steering document consultation summary**
   - Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags in your final output

## Important Notes

- **STEERING INTEGRATION**: Always read relevant steering documents to inform issue creation
- **LINEAR INTEGRATION**: When ticket IDs are provided, fetch Linear context to enhance issue quality
- **TECH DOC AGENT INTEGRATION**: Use tech-doc-agent when features involve specific libraries, frameworks, or technologies to include current best practices and implementation patterns
- **ISSUE CLARIFICATION BRAINSTORM**: Use interactive brainstorming to clarify ambiguous feature descriptions and gather comprehensive requirements
- **ARCHITECTURE AWARENESS**: Issues should reflect existing architectural patterns and constraints
- **PLAN OPTIMIZATION**: Create issues with sufficient detail for accurate `/plan` task breakdown
- **TECHNICAL DEPTH**: Include technical requirements that enable direct implementation planning (enhanced by tech-doc-agent insights and issue clarification when applicable)
- **BUSINESS CONTEXT**: Maintain clear connection between business value and technical implementation (enhanced by Linear context and user clarifications when available)
- **CONSISTENCY**: Ensure issue aligns with established patterns and standards from steering documents

## Error Handling

**If steering documents missing:**
- Inform user that steering documents don't exist
- Suggest running `/steering-setup` first for better issue quality
- Continue with basic issue creation but note limitations

**If Linear MCP unavailable or ticket not found:**
- Continue with standard issue creation process
- Log the ticket ID for future reference
- Note in the issue document that Linear context was not available

**If tech-doc-agent unavailable or library documentation insufficient:**
- Continue with standard issue creation process using web research
- Note in the issue document that library-specific context was limited
- Include general best practices from web research instead of specific library documentation

**If feature description unclear:**
- Ask clarifying questions about business context
- Request technical requirements if missing
- Ensure sufficient detail for implementation planning
